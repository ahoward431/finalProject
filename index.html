            Here, you can look at all kinds of cool statistics about the Measles and how the Measles Vaccine interacts with it.
            Look at Measles cases across 20 years to see how the vacinnated population keeps cases low!
            Examine data from the 2019 Measle's outbreak!
            Look at Autism rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated kids!
            Welp, that's it before I mosey on. Just remember to vaccinate your kids! It's good for both them and society! If you don't believe me, well I got the numbers to prove it!
